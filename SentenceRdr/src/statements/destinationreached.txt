Well, here we are. I always recommend going the EZ way in the future (assuming you don't stiff me that is)
All systems accounted for, your destination is reached. I believe there is still the matter of my payment...
Here we are. Your belonging are in the trunk. I will open it after you pay me...
Thanks for choosing EZ cabs! How would you like to pay?
